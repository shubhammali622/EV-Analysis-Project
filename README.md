## Project Overview

The EV (Electric Vehicle) Analysis Project focuses on analyzing data related to electric vehicles, identifying key trends, and uncovering valuable insights through an interactive dashboard built in Tableau. The project evaluates multiple variables such as vehicle sales, geographic trends, and key performance metrics to aid strategic decisions in the electric vehicle industry.

## Dashboard Features

### The Tableau dashboard includes various visualizations and interactive components:

- EV Sales Trends: A time-series analysis showing trends in electric vehicle sales over different time periods.

- Geographic Distribution: Insights into how EV adoption varies across different regions.

- Performance Metrics: Analysis of the key performance indicators (KPIs) related to electric vehicle efficiency, range, and cost.

- Interactive Filters:
  
  - Slicer by Year/Date: Allows users to explore sales data on a yearly or monthly basis.
    
  - Slicer by Vehicle Model/Type: Filters data to show results for specific models or types of      electric vehicles.
    
  - Slicer by Region/Country: Enables region-specific analysis to compare EV adoption in            different areas.

## How to Use the Dashboard

### To interact with the Tableau dashboard:

- Download the Tableau file and open it using Tableau Desktop.
  
- Utilize the slicers for deeper analysis:
  
  - Order Date Slicer for time-based trends.
    
  - Vehicle Model Slicer to analyze specific EV models.
    
  - Country Slicer for regional insights.
    
## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from publicly available electric vehicle datasets. It includes variables such as sales, market share, and efficiency metrics, organized by region, vehicle type, and time period.

## Conclusion for EV Analysis

- Total Vehicles: The analysis covers a total of 150,413 vehicles across different categories, providing a comprehensive overview of the electric vehicle (EV) landscape.

- Total Vehicles by Model Year: The distribution of vehicles by model year indicates a consistent growth in EV adoption. Newer model years show higher numbers, reflecting the increasing popularity and production of EVs in recent years.

- Total Vehicles by State: The data reveals that certain states lead in EV ownership, contributing significantly to the total number of vehicles. States like California, Texas, and Washington top the list, highlighting regions with robust infrastructure and policies favoring EV adoption.

- Top 5 Total Vehicles by Make: The top manufacturers in the EV market dominate the total vehicle count. Companies such as Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, BMW, and Ford make up the majority of the total vehicles, showcasing their prominence in the EV industry.

- Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility: A notable portion of the vehicles are Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles (CAFV) eligible, demonstrating compliance with environmental standards and government incentives that promote cleaner vehicle technologies.

- Total Vehicles by Model: When broken down by specific models, Tesla leads with models like the Tesla Model S and Tesla Model 3 contributing significantly to the total count, underscoring the brand's dominance in the EV market.

- Electric Range: The average electric range for the vehicles analyzed is 67.38 miles, highlighting advancements in battery technology, particularly for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), which typically have longer ranges compared to Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

- Total BEV and PHEV Vehicles:

   - BEV Vehicles: There are 116,745 BEV vehicles, which account for 77.6% of the total vehicle count. This high percentage reflects the growing preference for fully electric vehicles, which have zero emissions        and are a key component in reducing carbon footprints.
     
  - PHEV Vehicles: There are 33,668 PHEV vehicles, constituting 22.4% of the total. PHEVs, while contributing to emission reduction, provide the flexibility of using both electricity and traditional fuel, making      them a transitional option for some consumers.

## Key Insights

This analysis provides valuable insights into the current EV market trends, with a clear inclination towards fully electric vehicles, as seen by the high BEV percentage. Additionally, regional trends and model-specific data help understand the areas of growth and opportunities for manufacturers and policymakers.
