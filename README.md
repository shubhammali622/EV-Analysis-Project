## Project Overview

The EV (Electric Vehicle) Analysis Project focuses on analyzing data related to electric vehicles, identifying key trends, and uncovering valuable insights through an interactive dashboard built in Tableau. The project evaluates multiple variables such as vehicle sales, geographic trends, and key performance metrics to aid strategic decisions in the electric vehicle industry.

## Dashboard Features

### The Tableau dashboard includes various visualizations and interactive components:

- EV Sales Trends: A time-series analysis showing trends in electric vehicle sales over different time periods.

- Geographic Distribution: Insights into how EV adoption varies across different regions.

- Performance Metrics: Analysis of the key performance indicators (KPIs) related to electric vehicle efficiency, range, and cost.

- Interactive Filters:
  
  - Slicer by Year/Date: Allows users to explore sales data on a yearly or monthly basis.
    
  - Slicer by Vehicle Model/Type: Filters data to show results for specific models or types of      electric vehicles.
    
  - Slicer by Region/Country: Enables region-specific analysis to compare EV adoption in            different areas.

## How to Use the Dashboard

### To interact with the Tableau dashboard:

- Download the Tableau file and open it using Tableau Desktop.
  
- Utilize the slicers for deeper analysis:
  
  - Order Date Slicer for time-based trends.
    
  - Vehicle Model Slicer to analyze specific EV models.
    
  - Country Slicer for regional insights.
    
## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from publicly available electric vehicle datasets. It includes variables such as sales, market share, and efficiency metrics, organized by region, vehicle type, and time period.
